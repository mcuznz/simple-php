# Grow Your Own PHP App #

This Presentation follows the evolution of a Web App, from simple Flat HTML, to
Flat PHP, through to using a Framework.  Each Step of this evolution is stored
in a separate folder, each with an accompanying README detailing what changed
and improved from one step to the next.

We'll be using a simple Blog as our example application.

This is a work in progress.

## January PHPNiagara Meetup ##
Steps 1 through 9 were discussed at the January PHPNiagara Meetup.
