# Grow Your Own PHP App #

## STEP 4: Global Config ##

Things are starting to look better - we've got a system now that's much easier
to manage, add new content to, and restyle without having to repeat the same
code changes over and over.  In programming, we refer to this as being DRY:
Don't Repeat Yourself.

Keeping things DRY is one of the primary reasons for using a scripting language
like PHP in the first place.

On that note, there's one obvious bit of information that we're still repeating:
the Blog Title.  Let's change postdata.php to config.php, and add an array of
configuration values.  While the array will only have the Blog Title in it
currently and could be a single value, making it an array now will allow us to
expand it later.

I've also updated the posts array so that each post has an 'id' parameter.  This
is the same value as the array key pointing to the specific post, but makes
using the value just a little bit simpler.


## Files Present ##
 *  index.php:    the root of our application, listing available blog posts.
 *  post.php:     the blog post handler.
 *  template.php: the basic html used by all pages.
 *  config.php:   the global config data and blog post data used by all pages.

## Files Absent ##
 *  none!
