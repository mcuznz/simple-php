# Grow Your Own PHP App #

## STEP 9: Actions ##

This step is fairly simple - we've simply collected the content-generating logic
from different files into a group of functions in a single file.


## Files Present ##
 *  index.php:     repurposed - now the application controller.
 *  actions.php:   the single blog post and blog post list handlers.
 *  template.php:  the basic html used by all pages (updated).
 *  config.php:    the global config data used by all pages.
 *  model.php:     a group of functions for handling posts
 *  .htaccess:     Apache config file which sets up our mod_rewrite rule.

## Files Absent ##
 *  none!
