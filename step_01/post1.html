        <h1>A Simple Blog</h1>
        <h2>My First Blog Post</h2>
        <p>This is the first post in my new blog.  I wrote this myself using
        HTML in Notepad.  Someone told me I should use PHP - HA! What do they
        know?  This only took me a few minutes to set up and I didn't have to
        learn any fancy "scripting"!  I can even write my blog in MS Office if I
        want to - how cool is that?</p>
