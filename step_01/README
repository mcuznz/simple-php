## STEP 1: Flat HTML ##

Chances are pretty good you've dealt with Flat HTML - whether it was a school
project, one of the first web pages you created, or something you inherited from
a client who thought they could make their own website, almost all of us have
had to deal with a plain, static HTML file at some point.

They certainly have their advantages - requiring no processing or database
connections, they're damn fast. Flat HTML pages are often used to shed server
load when a certain page becomes intensely popular (such as being linked from
Reddit or Digg).

They're also really hard to manage if any of the content needs to be updated
on a regular basis or if the look-and-feel of the page needs to change.
